This is the BU Django base project.

QUICKSTART:

  $ cd vagrant
  $ vagrant up
  
  http://localhost:8080

You can always download the latest from GitHub via:

  https://github.com/kgrinberg/bu-django-bootstrap/tarball/master

You'll want to rename ``myproject`` to something more appropriate, as well as
do a number of setup tasks - see /docs/new-project.txt for a checklist.

Documentation is in /docs/, code in /myproject/

docs/new-project.txt describes the first steps for a new project - start with that.

Once you start your project, replace this file with project-specific
documentation here and in /docs/, or specify where it can be found
(SharePoint, Google Docs, etc. - precise links help).

As you begin the project, take 5 minutes to review the Django coding style
guide:

  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/#coding-style
