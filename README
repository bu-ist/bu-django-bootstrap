This is the BU Django base project.

You'll want to rename ``myproject`` to something more appropriate, as well as
do a number of setup tasks - see /docs/new-project.txt for a checklist.

As a general rule, make sure you've "exported" this project bootstrap rather
than cloning the repo - basically, we want to make sure that you start a NEW
project based on these defaults, and don't end up accidentally committing
project-specific code back to this project bootstrap.

If you checked it out from git, you'll want to do something like:

$ git checkout-index --prefix=/home/projects/myproject/ -a

...where "/home/projects/myproject/" is the path you want to export it to -
basically the initial working copy of your project, except without the
budjango repo.  Note: using "~" in the --prefix argument can have some
weird side effects, so try to avoid it.

Documentation is in /docs/, code in /myproject/

docs/new-project.txt describes the first steps for a new project.

Once you start your project, replace this file with project-specific
documentation here and in /docs/, or specify where it can be found
(SharePoint, Google Docs, etc. - precise links help).

As you begin the project, take 5 minutes to review the Django coding style
guide:
